Paranoik
========

Paranoik is a Python Framework, intended to easify automation of backups on servers and developers' machines. Most of the currently available backup solutions are too hard to configure, have a big learning curve, and are not written in Python. :) Since now I have tried a bunch of backup tools, but no one fully satisfied my needs.

Overview
--------

Paranoik provides a mechanism to backup different things on a server, like:

* Directories
* MySQL Databases
* PostgreSQL Databases
* etc.

Separate components that define backup logic are called "backup providers". It is pretty easy to create new backup providers.
